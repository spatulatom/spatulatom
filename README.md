## About me
- studing online on Udemy/Codecademy, 
- [![LinkedIn][linkedin-shield]][linkedin-url].
- Hello, I'm Tom, a self-taught web developer with a strong focus on building robust web applications. I have gained proficiency in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and subsequently explored React.js and the MERN stack.
<br/>My current projects primarily utilize Next.js with TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL for backend development. (While I have acquired familiarity with Prisma and PostgreSQL, I am continuously expanding my knowledge of these intricate technologies.) For styling, I rely on Tailwind CSS, and media storage is handled by Cloudinary and Uploadcare. To ensure code quality, I employ React Testing Library for unit testing.
<br/> I am particularly enthusiastic about the recent advancements in React.js and Next.js, especially the introduction of server components, which has brought about a significant paradigm shift in frontend and backend divisions within web development. I eagerly anticipate further updates and advancements in these technologies.
  <br/>
